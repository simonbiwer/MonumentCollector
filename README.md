# Monument Collector

### Start application

- Install dependencies `npm install`
- Start server application for 3D models `arqiv` (https://github.com/simonbiwer/arqiv)
- If needed adjust `localhostIP` and `port` in [constants](src/constants.ts)
- Start the application with `expo start` (to show the app in the browser use `--web`)
- Note: If you want to use --web the nfc utils need to be disabled, because they are only available on phones
